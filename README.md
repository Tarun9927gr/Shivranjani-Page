## ❖Technologies Used:
### • Django (Python): A high-level web
framework that powers the backend of our
website.
### • HTML5 & CSS3: For creating structured
and styled content.
### • Bootstrap: For responsive, mobile-first
design that adapts across different
devices.
### • JavaScript: For interactive features and
dynamic content updates.
### • Django Database
(SQLite/PostgreSQL): For managing
and storing event data, member
information, and more.
# ➢What is Django?
Django is a high-level Python web framework
that enables developers to build robust,
scalable, and secure web applications
quickly. It follows the Model-View-Template
(MVT) architectural pattern, which organizes
the development process efficiently. Django is
known for its "batteries-included" approach,
meaning it comes with built-in features such
as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), user
authentication, form handling, and more.
Key Features of Django:
### • Fast Development: It allows rapid
development of web applications.
### • Security: Protects against common web
vulnerabilities like SQL injection, crosssite scripting (XSS), and cross-site
request forgery (CSRF).
### • Scalability: Suitable for projects ranging
from simple websites to large-scale
applications.
### • Built-in Admin Interface: Django
provides an auto-generated admin panel
to manage your application data.
Creating a Virtual Environment in
Django?
# ➢ What is a Virtual Environment?
A virtual environment is an isolated
environment in Python that allows you to
install and manage dependencies (libraries,
packages) for a specific project without
affecting the global Python installation. It
ensures that different projects can have
different versions of dependencies.
Steps to Create and Activate a Virtual
Environment
#### 1. Install virtual env (if not installed): Open your
terminal or command prompt and type:
‘py -m venv Tarun1’ (here my virtual name
is Tarun1)
#### 1. Activate the Virtual Environment:
‘Tarun1\Scripts\activate’
What Changes Does a Virtual
Environment Make?
#### I. Environment Isolation: When activated,
Python and pip commands use the local
(isolated) environment instead of the
global one.
#### II. Custom pip Package Directory:
Dependencies are installed in the venv
folder instead of the global system.
#### III. Environment-Specific python and pip:
Activating the virtual environment
overrides the system’s Python and pip
paths.
# Installing Django Using pip
After creating and activating a virtual
environment, the next step is to install
Django. This is done using Python's
package manager, pip.

## • Steps to Install Django:
#### 1. Ensure the Virtual Environment is
Activated: Before installing Django,
ensure you have activated the virtual
environment. The terminal prompt will
show the name of the virtual
environment (e.g., (myM)).
#### 2. Run the Installation Command: Use
the following command to install
django:
“pip install django”
Creating a Django Project
Once Django is installed, the next step is
to create a new Django project. A project
serves as the container for your web
application and manages settings,
URLs, and overall configuration.
Command to Create a Project:
To create a Django project, use the
Django-admin command as follows:
‘django-admin startproject mywebsite’
What Happens After Running This
Command?
When you run django-admin startproject
mywebsite, Django creates the following
directory structure:
Explanation of Files and Folders:
Mywebsite (Outer Folder): This is the root folder of your project.
It contains all the files related to your Django project.
manage.py:
A Python script used to manage the project.
You can use it to run the server, create apps, and execute other
management tasks.
mywebsite (Inner Folder):
This folder contains the core settings and configurations for your Django
project.
Files inside the inner meal/ folder:
#### __init__.py:
Indicates that this directory is a Python package.
settings.py:
Contains all the project settings, such as database configuration,
middleware, installed apps, etc.
#### urls.py:
Maps URLs to views. This is where you define the URL patterns for your
project.
#### asgi.py:
Stands for Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface.
Used for handling asynchronous web requests.
#### wsgi.py:
Stands for Web Server Gateway Interface.
Used to deploy the application on a production server.
Navigating to the Project Folder
After creating the project, navigate to the outer folder (meal) to
start working on your project. Use the following commands:
‘cd meal’
Starting the Django Development Server
Once your Django project is set up, you can run a development
server to test your application locally. Use the following
command:
‘py manage.py runserver’.
The command launches a lightweight server for development
purposes. By default, the server runs on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
(localhost, port 8000).
How to Access the Server?
Open your web browser and visit:
‘http://127.0.0.1:8000/’
You’ll see Django's default welcome page, confirming the
server is running.
 Creating a Django App
In Django, an app is a modular component that handles specific
functionality of your project. For example, in your project meal,
you might have an app for handling orders. To create an app,
use the following command:
‘python manage.py startapp hello_world’
 What Happens After Running This Command?
Django creates a folder named orderr with the following
structure:
# Explanation of the Files and Folders:
### 1. hello_world (App Folder):
• The root folder of your app containing all the files specific
to this app.
•
### 2. Files in hello_world:
• __init__.py:
o Indicates that this directory is a Python package.
• admin.py:
o Used to register models so they can be managed via
Django’s admin interface.
• apps.py:
o Contains app configuration settings.
• models.py:
o Used to define the database schema by creating
models.
• tests.py:
o Contains test cases for the app.
• views.py:
o Defines the logic for processing requests and
returning responses.
### 3. migrations:
• A folder to store migration files, which track database
schema changes.
• __init__.py:
o Indicates that this is a Python package.
### 4. Static:
All images and videos will be stored here.
After creating the app, you need to:
Add the App to the Project:
• Open settings.py in your project folder.
• Add 'hello_world', to the INSTALLED_APPS list.
Creating the template Folder:
• In your Django app (order), you created a folder named
template.
• This folder is where you store all your HTML files, which
define the structure and content of your website’s pages.
Adding HTML Files in the template Folder:
1. Shiv.html
2. about.html
3. achievement.html:
4. annual.html:
5. members.html:
6. mission.html
7. shivlog.html
➢ Shiv.html
➢ Shivlog.html
➢ about.html
➢ members.html
➢ mission.html
➢ achievement.html
# Django Views
When we create a new app (order), the views.py file contains
only:
 ‘from django.shortcuts import render’
What You Need to Add:
For your Online Food Delivery website (meal1 project, orderr
app), we added:
### 1. Additional Imports:
• HttpResponse: For sending plain text or basic responses.
• redirect: To navigate users to a different page.
• User: To manage user accounts (e.g., create a user).
• authenticate, login, logout: To handle user
authentication (if needed later).

 hello_world(website) URLs
In Django, before we can use certain functionality like working
with the admin site or routing URLs, we need to import specific
modules and classes. These imports are essential to make the
features of Django available in your project.
Here's how we write the imports, step-by-step:
### 1. ‘from django.contrib import admin’
This line allows you to use Django's built-in admin interface,
which is a powerful tool for managing your site’s data.
You don't need to write code for managing your models
manually, as the admin interface provides an easy-to-use
dashboard.
### 2. ‘from django.urls import path’
 This is essential for URL routing. It allows you to create and
manage the paths (URLs) for your website. By using the path()
function, you can associate specific URLs (like /order/ or /menu/)
with
corresponding views (functions that display pages or handle data).
 Without this import, Django wouldn't know how to handle
incoming web requests based on their URLs.
### 3. ‘from order import views’
• In Django, views are the Python functions that handle
user requests and return a response (usually a
webpage). By importing views from the order app,
you're able to link specific URLs to the views that
should be triggered when those URLs are visited.
• For example, views.aboutpage will be used to display
the "about" page when the /about/ URL is accessed.
Make Migrations
In Django, migrations are how Django tracks
changes to your database schema (like adding,
modifying, or deleting models). When you make
any changes to your models (like adding new
fields, creating new models, or changing
existing ones), Django needs to know about
those changes to update the database
accordingly.
To achieve this, you use the makemigrations
command. This command tells Django to
prepare migration files that describe the
changes to your models. It doesn’t actually
apply those changes to the database — it just
prepares the necessary files.
Steps for migration
•
‘python manage.py makemigrations’
Django will look at your models.py file, detect
that you've added a new field (description), and
generate a migration file in the migrations folder
of your app.
• ‘python manage.py migrate’
This will apply all the pending migrations
(including the one that adds the description
field) to the database, so your database
schema matches your updated models.
# ➢ Create Superuser
o Run the following command to start the process of creating a
superuser:
‘python manage.py createsuperuser’
o Provide the Superuser Information: The system will ask you
for the following details:
o Username: The username of the superuser (e.g., admin).
o Email: The email address for the superuser
o Password: A strong password for the superuser.
o Confirmation: Once you’ve entered the information and
confirmed the password, Django will create the superuser and
provide a confirmation message like this:
‘Superuser created successfully’
This means the superuser has been created, and you can now log
into the Django Admin.
➢Logging into the Admin Site
Now that you’ve created a superuser, you can access the Django
admin site:
Step 1: Run the Django Development Server: If the server
is not already running, you need to start it with the following
command:
‘python manage.py runserver’
Step 2: Visit the Admin Site: Open your web browser and go
to the following URL to access the Django admin interface:
‘http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/’
Step 3: Log in: Enter the username and password that you used
when creating the superuser. This will give you access to the
Django admin dashboard.
Example Code and Command Flow:
Here’s an example of how the command flow will look like when
you run createsuperuser:
# ➢Creating a Data Flow
Creating a data flow diagram (DFD) is a visual representation of how
data flows through a system. In the context of the College Music Society
website, we can create a simple data flow diagram to illustrate the flow
of information between different components of the system. Here's a
basic example:
Data Flow Diagram for College Music Society Website:
## 1. External Entities:
• Users: Individuals accessing the website to view events,
news, and other content.
• Administrators: Authorized personnel responsible for
managing website content and user accounts.
## 2. Processes:
• User Interaction: Users interact with the website interface
to perform actions such as viewing event listings, reading
news articles, registering for events.
## 3. Data Stores:
• Database: Central repository for storing website data,
including user profiles.
## 4. Data Flows:
• User Requests:
• Users send requests for specific pages or actions (e.g.,
viewing events, registering for membership) through
the website interface.
• Requests are received by the web server and
processed accordingly.
• Website Content:
• Event listings, news articles, multimedia content, and
other website content are retrieved from the database
in response to user requests.
• Content is formatted and presented to users through
the website interface.
• User Interactions:
• User interactions such as event registrations,
membership sign-ups, comments, and feedback are
captured and processed by the web server.
• Data related to user interactions is stored or updated in
the database as needed.
➢ Content Management:
• Administrators access the website's backend system to
create, edit, or delete content.
• Changes made by administrators are saved to the
database and reflected on the public-facing website.
➢ Data Dictionary:
Attributes:
• Username: User's chosen username for login.
• Password: Encrypted password for user authentication.
• Email: User's email address.
• FirstName: User's first name.
• LastName: User's last name.
This data dictionary outlines the entities, attributes, and relationships
present in the College Music Society website's database schema. It
provides a clear reference for developers and stakeholders to
understand the structure and organization of the website's data.
# ➢ ER Diagram Representation

relationship between User and Private Information).
➢ A Mission is general and does not directly link to users but can be
managed by admins.
# Conclusion
The music society website is designed to provide a
secure, user-friendly platform for managing society
activities and information. It features a clear structure with
sections such as Home, About, Mission, Members, and a
secure login system for accessing private information. The
website ensures data confidentiality by restricting sensitive
information to authorized users through role-based access
controls for members and admins. Members can view and
manage their profiles, including roles like vocalists or
instrumentalists, while admins oversee society operations
efficiently. The mission section promotes transparency by
showcasing the society's goals and fostering alignment
among visitors and members. Additionally, login tracking
enhances accountability by monitoring user activity.
Overall, the website balances ease of use, security, and
efficient management, creating an engaging and
collaborative experience for the music society’s members
and visitors.
